    <h1>Welcome to My Page!!</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Pallavi, a third-year Computer Science Engineering student passionate about technology, coding, and continuous learning. This is my first step into web development during my internship, and I’m excited to build and improve my skills by working on these projects.
        Outside of academics, I find joy in coding, listening to music, and playing badminton, which helps me maintain a balanced lifestyle. As I move forward in my journey, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech community and make a positive impact through my work.
